# NLP -- Project Series-7 ---> Spam Detector using Various ML Classifier ( NLP )

Aim-> Is to classify whether the given message is either spam or ham message using ML classifiers and NLP techniques

Methodology->

The dataset used: Kaggle Spam classification dataset

There were about 5500+ messages in this dataset, labelled as either spam or ham message. In this dataset, it was found that about 4800+ messages were ham messages and rest were classified as spam messages. From analysis it was noted that, number of words used in spam messages is quite high when compared with normal messages.


NLP techniques such as tokenization, punctuation removal, stops words removals, were done to clean the data.


Various ML classifers were used for model training such as SVM, KNN, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression etc


Conclusion -> It was found that, Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved the highest accuracy with 93.18%.
